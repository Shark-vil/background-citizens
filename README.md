## General
***
### **Short information**
This is an addon that will automatically spawn NPCs on the map at predetermined movement points. NPCs can walk around the map, perform random actions, attack or defend.

### **Performance**
The addon is quite optimized and almost does not generate lags. NPCs are removed when they disappear from the player's field of view, and appear with a certain delay. The spawn process is performed between server frames, which does not create unnecessary lags.

### **Assignment**
This addon can rather be considered a base for development. There is basic functionality here, but if you are a developer, you can fairly easily extend the system to suit your conditions and for any gamemode.
